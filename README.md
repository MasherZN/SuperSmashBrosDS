# ***Smash Bros. Strike***

This project was born as a spontaneous idea when I remembered, Hey, there is no Smash Bros for the Nintendo Ds...How about I do it?
Simply a project made with love from a fan, for fans.

#### What are the goals?


- Create a smash game that feels as faithful as possible to the original saga, with its own touch but that fills that gap of a smash that never existed for the DS

- Have a satisfactory gameplay, the fastest and smoothest that the DS can support in its capacity Diagram of Markdown extended syntax;

- Have a beautiful graphic appearance

#### How to build

- Make sure you have the latest version of Devkitpro and nflib:

- Download the source code
- Use *msys2* to locate the project directory and then type *make*.

There you have your rom!
